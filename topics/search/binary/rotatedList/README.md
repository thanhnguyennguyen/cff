# Put some descriptions here 
Given a ascending sorted list, then we try to rotate this list at a rotated point.
Let search an element in this list , return its index or -1 if it's not in the list
example:
5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4
find(6) = 1
find(8) = 3
find(11) = -1
# Put your solutions here
- Find the rotated point
- Binary search on those 2 sorted lists

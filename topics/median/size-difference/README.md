Median of two sorted arrays of different sizes
This is an extension of median of two sorted arrays of equal size problem. Here we handle arrays of unequal size also.
The approach discussed in this post is similar to method 2 of equal size post. The basic idea is same, we find the median of two arrays and compare the medians to discard almost half of the elements in both arrays.
